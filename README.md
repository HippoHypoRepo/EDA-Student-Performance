# EDA on a Student Performance Dataset

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics/data).

The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to academic performance based on various demographic and socioeconomic factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course status.
